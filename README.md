## Overview 

An endless runner where the player controls a cube, having to precisely time jumps to safely land on platforms and avoid collisions, while trying to achieve the longest run that results in the highest score. The platforms are procedurally generated, ensuring no two runs are ever the same. Two gamemodes are available to further diversify the player experience -- one with normal gravity mechanics, and one where the gravity is inverted every time the cube jumps. Completed as a part of **CGRA151 - Introduction to Computer Graphics and Games** course projects.
This game was largely inspired by Geometry Dash by RobTop Games.

## Features

- Procedurally generated platforms using a custom algorithm that ensures the feasibility of each jump
- Camera algorithm that follows the cube's vertical movement
- Multi-layer parallax background
